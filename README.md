## Travel Suvey Tools
`newPackage` is an R package that empowers users of household travel survey (HTS) data to create meaningful summaries of their data. Currently, `newPackage` is compatible with RSG, Inc. HTS datasets. These datasets usually contain six tables: household, person, day, trip, vehicle, and location. In the future, we may expand `newPackage` to work with other types of travel survey data or other types of surveys.

`newPackage` is in active development and is open-source; anyone can contribute ü§ù. See the CONTRIBUTING page to learn how.
