## TMR Tools

### Vision:

* to be an internal repository of the standard tools for doing our work
* this is not a replacement for tmrscripts
* when should something get added to tmrtools?
  * anytime you find yourself writing or referring to the same bit of code across projects
  * or even with a project, if you write the same bit a code again and again
* this package will continue to get maintenance and evolve over time
